Hospital Management Software
CareMD(Improved version of Care2x), is currently implemented to 50+ Health facilities here in Tanzania. 
It is an open source software although the community is not active since 2011. 
In 2004 ELCT(Evangelical Lutheran Church In Tanzania) adopted Care2x. ELCT own 24 hospitals and up to 148 Health Centres and dispensaries. ELCT wanted to digitalize all its hospitals and Health centres, ELCT establised ICT Unit that was under Health department, the aim of this unit was to support and implement Care2x to ELCT health facilities. The project was piloted at Selian Town Clinic in 2004, this clinic is now upgraded to zonal hospital, it still using Care2x(now CareMD). Donor who funded this project pulled out in 2011. The project was funded by IICD(International Institute for Communication and Development),FELM(Finish Evangelical Lutheran Mission). Software Customization/Deveopment was done by Merotech IT Engineering LTD from German. 
I was one of the staff member of ELCT ICT Unit, I decided to turn this project into a business. We have been doing improvements of Care2x, recently we did a major change in Care2x, below are the changes that we did:-
1. We moved Care2x to bootstrap(It is now mobile compatible. It fits well on mobile screen)
2. We migrated it to PHP 7.3 and mysql 5.7
3. We added a dashboard with patient statics in line graph,bar chart and pie chart
4. We installed a dicom viewer
5. Integrated with lab devices such as DH76, ACCENT220s and MS4

We decided to change the name from Care2x to CareMD because we wanted to differenciate it with original Care2x. CareMD is integrated with webERP version 4.15, webERP is a complete web based accounting and business management system. We are based in Arusha Tanzania.
